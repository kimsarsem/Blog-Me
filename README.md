# Blog-Me
Tabpy project 3/3 from Python and Tableau: The Complete Data Analytics Bootcamp! on Udemy by Dee Naidoo

Sentiment and Keyword Analysis: Weâ€™re also going to be doing a sentiment and keyword analysis for Blog Me. A blogging website that would like us to analyze news headlines and extract a sentiment from these articles. Here, we use a Natural Language Processing Library called Vader, that can extract sentiment on Python. We also learn about functions and classes on Python. Once we extract the data to Tableau, we learn how to perform Tableau Joins, work with sets and context filtering and finally create an interactive dashboard.
